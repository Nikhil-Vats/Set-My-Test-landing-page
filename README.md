This repository can save the user and suggest User names for website account but it can do that locally because it is not configured right
now to interact with an online database so to check that functionality, you need to do following - 
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install mongoose and MongoDB(ROBO) app.
3. Configure the MongoDB for using it locally.
4. Run index.js in command prompt while running mongo on another command prompt.
5. Open the website on a localhost server. 

Boom, you can now actually save the users and get suggested userNames for the website account.
